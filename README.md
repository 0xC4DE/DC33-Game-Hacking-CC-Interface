# DEFCON 33 Game Hacking Village Computer Craft Lab

This is the repo that has all of the files that are relevant to the computer craft activity that was present at DEFCON 33 Game Hacking Village.

There isn't much context to many of the files, however I do have this singular screenshot explaining the infrastructure of each puzzle.
