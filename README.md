# DEFCON 33 Game Hacking Village Computer Craft Lab

This is the repo that has all of the files that are relevant to the computer craft activity that was present at DEFCON 33 Game Hacking Village.

There isn't much context to many of the files, however I do have this singular screenshot explaining the infrastructure of each puzzle.

The util_datapack is needed for the computers in the world to function, This makes updating any broken script pretty annoying but there's not much to do about that. The copyfiles.ps1 can copy over all the puzzle/util computers that are needed to make it work. The text computers were placed manually.

Overall, I'm happy with how the lab/workshop went. I hope to do some even cooler stuff next year, maybe even an entire coding challenge, ctf, or similar. keep an eye out for DefCon 34!!
